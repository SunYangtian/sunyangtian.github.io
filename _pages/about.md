I am Yang-Tian Sun, a PhD student in the University of Hong Kong supervised by Prof. [Xiaojuan Qi](https://xjqi.github.io/). Before that, I got the master degree in [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ict.cas.cn) supervised by Prof. [Lin Gao](http://www.geometrylearning.com) and the bachelor degree of science from [University of Science and Technology Beijing](https://en.ustb.edu.cn/).

My current research mainly focuses on neural rendering. Moreover, I'm also very interested in geometry processing, physical-based rendering.
